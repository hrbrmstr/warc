expand(buffer, size = length(buffer) * 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{buffer}{gz compressed buffer to expand}

\item{size}{estimated size of the inflated buffer}

\description{
Expand a compressed raw buffer

\note{
Guess \code{size} well since this will fail if \code{size}
  is not large enough to hold the uncompressed output.
